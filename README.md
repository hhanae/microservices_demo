## How It Works

Microservice architecture aims to provide manageability to large, resource-intensive applications. Since each individual microservice performs one narrowly focused task (application function), they can be updated independently of other components. Thus, scaling and changing existing functionality is carried out with minimal resource consumption and downtime.

As for the principles of operation of a separate microservice, it lies in the fact that when a client generates a request with the help of the user interface, which, through the API gateway, activates the microservice (or several of them) responsible for executing this request.

Thus, even the most complex multi-stage tasks can be implemented with the least resource consumption. At the same time, a combination of various microservices gives companies access to solving a wide variety of problems without requiring the implementation of full-fledged software components with independent interfaces.


## Prerequisites

Creating a microservices project with Spring Boot involves several prerequisites. Here are the key prerequisites you'll need to set up before starting your microservices project:

* Java Development Kit (JDK)
* Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA
* Knowledge of Spring Boot Features
* Containerization Tool: DOCKER
* Database: MySQL
   

## Project Structure

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
